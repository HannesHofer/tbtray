# tbtray
A rough hash up for a thunderbird tray addon for linux.

Its not really meant for anyone else to use but iv got nothing against people using it. Keep in mind im probably the worlds
worst coder. I'm doing this to try and learn a little about using git and github.

<b>you will need xdotool & wmctrl installed and Its a PyQt5 project </b>

<b>pacman -S wmctrl xdotool</b>

All you need to do is run tbtray.py and set up your Inbox.msf file. You might need to first remove any paths listed in the
main profile box (select it and click remove) then find (or manualy enter) the path your Inbox.msf files in the top bar.
DON'T forget to add them to the main list by clicking the "add" button before you finnsh.

i.e :-
"/home/user/.thunderbird/tdvx3gPn.default/Mail/smart mailboxes/Inbox.msf"
