# tbtray
A rough hash up for a thunderbird tray addon

Its not really meant for anyone else to use but iv got nothing against people using it. Keep in mind im probably the worlds
worst coder :P im doing this to try and learn a little about using git and github.

At the moment it only looks at the unified inbox.

<b>you will need xdotool installed and Its a PyQt5 project <b>

All you need to do is run tbtray.py


P.S. untill i have done the settings you will need to manualy change the target path to your own path
