# tbtray
A rough hash up for a thunderbird tray addon

Its not really meant for anyone else to use but iv got nothing against people using it. Keep in mind im probably the worlds
worst coder. I'm doing this to try and learn a little about using git and github.

At the moment it only looks at a single .msf file, suited best for the unified inbox ATM.

<b>you will need xdotool installed and Its a PyQt5 project <b>

All you need to do is run tbtray.py and set your Inbox.msf file

i.e :-
"/home/user/.thunderbird/tdvx3gPn.default/Mail/smart mailboxes/Inbox.msf"
